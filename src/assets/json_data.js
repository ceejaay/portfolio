      description: "This project was a challenge because we had five people working on the entire project. We had a standup each morning to decide what each of us would do for that day. I worked on a mix of backend, frontend and documentation. The most challenging and enjoyable part of this project was researching and implementing the Watson API. I had to read a lot of documentation. I pair-programmed with a colleauge to get the right data from the Watson API.",

      description: "Please note: There are no pull requests for this project. My project manager and I were simply merging our branches without pull requsts.  My primary work on this project was on the backend. I planned and executed the database schema. I prepared all the endpoints for the React developer to access. The challenging part of this project was to communicate clearly with the React developer. We had to be clear how the data would get from front end to the backend. ",
